# Hi, everyone!

I am Bum Chul Kwon ("BC"), a research scientist at IBM Research, Cambridge, MA. My research goal is to enhance users' abilities to gain insights from data through interactive visualization systems. I am also interested in making machine learning algorithms more transparent, solving real-world heathcare problems, and improving data visualization literacy!
